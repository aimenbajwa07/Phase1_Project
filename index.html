              <h2>Nalini Singh</h2>
              <p>Nalini Singh was born in Fiji and raised in New Zealand. She spent three years living and working in Japan, where she took the chance to travel around Asia. She's back in New Zealand now, but she's always plotting new trips. If you’d like to see some of her travel snapshots, have a look at her Travel Diary page.

                She's worked as a lawyer, a librarian, a candy factory general hand, a bank temp and an English teacher, but not necessarily in that order. Some might call that inconsistency, but she call it grist for the writer’s mill.
                She is the bestselling author of Psy-Changeling  and Guild Hunter series</p>
